## Projects 👩‍💻
These are some of my favorite projects that I've completed in my time working in a digital marketing agency setting. I've had the pleasure of working with brands big and small. From local, family-owned businesses to Fortune 500, enterprise-level brands, I've helped companies leverage data to inform business decisions.
